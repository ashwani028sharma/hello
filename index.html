        Life is full of strange experiencesâ€”good and bad,<br> happy and sad. Some of these experiences<br> are just unforgettable. I can never forget my first <br>day at college. It was a day of thrill, j<br>oy and excitement. But it turned out to be a real bad day indeed.<br> Wearing new clothes, I entered the college gate. <br>I was feeling proud of being a college student.
