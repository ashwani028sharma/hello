        Life is full of strange experiencesâ€”good and bad, happy and sad. Some of these experiences are just unforgettable. I can never forget my first day at college. It was a day of thrill, joy and excitement. But it turned out to be a real bad day indeed. Wearing new clothes, I entered the college gate. I was feeling proud of being a college student.
